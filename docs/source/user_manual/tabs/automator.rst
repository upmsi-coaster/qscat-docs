Shorelines

Shoreline Fields
----------------
This feature allows the user to add the required fields for the shoreline layer input, namely:

a. Input layer - a shapefile of the merged shorelines  

b. Date field name - date of the source of shoreline data, with mm/yyyy format 

c. Uncertainty field name - uncertainty due to measurement and/or positional accuracy inherent in the source of shoreline data. On a 1:50,000 topographic map, for example, a 1 mm line representing the shoreline is equivalent to 50 m in actual ground units, which translates to measurement uncertainty of +/- 25 m.

The required data format is given below.
