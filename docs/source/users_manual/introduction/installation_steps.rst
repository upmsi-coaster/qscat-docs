By ZIP File
===========

Latest QSCAT plugin is currently available as a ZIP file for installation. The steps to install the plugin on any operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS) are as follows:

1. Download the qscat.zip file from the following link: https://github.com/louisfacun/qscat/releases/latest
2. Open QGIS, :menuselection:`Settings --> User Profiles --> Open Active Profile Folder`. This will open the folder where the plugin content should be copied.
3. Navigate to the |python| > |plugins| folder.
4. Open the qscat zip folder and copy the qscat folder in the zip file to |python| > |plugins| folder. Alternatively,  unzip the qscat folder first, then copy and paste the qscat folder in the unzipped folder to the |python| > |plugins| folder. 
5. Close and reopen QGIS. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins`. The `QGIS' Shoreline Change Analysis Tool` should now appear in the list if the qscat folder was copied correctly. Check the checkbox to enable the plugin.
6. Once enabled, the `QSCAT` plugin will appear in the toolbar.
