QGISâ€™ Shoreline Change Analysis Tool (QSCAT) is a plugin developed using the freeware Quantum GIS (QGIS). It is patterned after the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), an ArcGIS add-in. Being QGIS-based, QSCAT is more readily accessible than DSAS. Similar to DSAS, QSCAT computes the rate and magnitude of shoreline changes for different time periods. It can generate commonly used shoreline change statistics such as net shoreline movement (NSM), end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) from a time series of shoreline vectors.

Although the output statistics of this plugin is more limited than what DSAS is capable of, QSCAT has some additional features. The Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) function can compare any two shoreline vectors as it provides a menu for selecting the time period for comparison. More importantly, it can estimate the length and areal extent of the eroding, stable and accreting coastal segments. Such information is important for coastal erosion studies.
