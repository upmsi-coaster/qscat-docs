Shoreline Fields
----------------

The :menuselection:`Shorelines Fields` automator simplifies the process of adding attributes by automatically assigning pre-defined data types and custom field names. By simply defining the desired field name, the plugin takes care of the necessary data type assignments for each field.

# Input layer: A vector layer containing the merged shorelines.

# Date field name: The field name that represents the date of the source of shoreline data, following the format mm/yyyy.

# Uncertainty field name: The field name that captures the uncertainty associated with the measurement and/or positional accuracy inherent in the source of shoreline data.
