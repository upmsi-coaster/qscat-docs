Pairwise Comparison of Shorelines
=================================

By default, NSM and EPR calculate the magnitude and rate of shoreline changes respectively between the oldest and most recent shorelines even if multiple shorelines are available. In QSCAT, the algorithm for calculating NSM and EPR can be applied to any two shorelines from the selected shorelines layer by specifying the dates of the two shorelines for comparison.While LRR can estimate the net rate of change among multiple shorelines, the pairwise comparison can lead to a better understanding of how the shoreline has evolved over different time periods, and the possible causes of the observed trends.
 
The output file is a temporary file with the following format: name of area_NSM (inclusive date)[date and time of QSCAT run].
